# Detailed explanation of different scenarios:
# diLuzio : arXiv [1705.05370], classic axion band between E/N = 44/3 and E/N = 5/3.
#           Contains all KSVZ models with one additional quark and all DFSZ models with one additional Higgs doublet.
#           Not a band in a statistical sense, rather a region of the parameterspace where several DISCREET models lie. Use when interested in minimal extensions.
# KSVZ    : arXiv [2107.12378], bands and one-sided limits derived from Plakkot&Hoof.
#           Contains complete set of preferred KSVZ models with up to nine additional quark, assuming equal probability for all models.
#           Use when specifically interested in KSVZ models beyond minimal extensions.
# DFSZ    : this work, bands and one-sided limits.
#           Contains DFSZ models with up to nine higgs doublets, extrapolating beyond DFSZ₇, assuming equal probability for all numbers of Higgs doublets.
#           Contrary to KSVZ case no phenomenological selection criteria were applied.
#           Use when specifically interested in DFSZ models beyond minimal extensions.
# Combined: bands and one-sided limits for KSVZ and DFSZ case combined assuming equal probability for a DFSZ axion and for a KSVZ axion.
#           Use if you have no preference for DFSZ or KSVZ and want to consider beyond minimal extensions.
# N_DW=1  : bands and one-sided limits for KSVZ and DFSZ case combined assuming equal probability for a DFSZ axion and for a KSVZ axion, only considering models with domain wall number of one.
#           DFSZ case only includes DFSZ₂ to DFSZ₆. No extrapolation beyond.
#           Use if you have no preference for DFSZ or KSVZ, want to consider beyond minimal extensions, are interested in the post-inflationary scenario and believe that the domain wall problem is indeed a problem.
#
# All values given are |E/N - 1.92| corresponding to the presented limits.
# All limits given are one-sided. For a central 68% axion band use 0.16 and 0.84 limits, or a central 95% axion band use 0.975 and 0.025.
